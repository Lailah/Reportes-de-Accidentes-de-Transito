==Traffic Report==

The purpose of this programme is to analyse information about traffic jams and accidents, identifying the "hot spots" to avoid, weaknesses, local needs and alternative routes to safely travel.
Data should come from open sources available online or requesting authorities to share/open their information related to traffic.
Originally, this application was part of a hackathon named "Desarrollando America Latina" and located in different countries, sourching data for this specific project in Montevideo and its City Council.
Although European countries have a far lower rate of traffic accidents, this is still a problem and citizens can minimise risks with access to good and reliable information.
This programme is FLOSS and is under GPL 2
